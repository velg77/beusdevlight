SUMMARY:&#039\;THUG&#039\; Event
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Description:\nBaker-Bell\, assistant professor in the Departmen
 t of English and\nAfrican-American and African Studies program\, and Johns
 on\, assistant\nprofessor in the Department of English\, chose \"The Hate 
 U Give\"\nbecause it fosters opportunities for language study beyond stand
 ard\nAmerican English. Instead\, the course challenges students to conside
 r\nhow language\, particularly black or African-American language\, inform
 s\nidentity and experience.\n\n“For me\, 'The Hate U Give' illustrates h
 ow black language reflects\nblack people’s ways of knowing\, interpretin
 g\, surviving and being in\nthe world\,” Baker-Bell said. “The book al
 so shows how it is nearly\nimpossible to separate a person’s language fr
 om their racial\npositioning in society. Most of the students in ENG 302 a
 re preparing\nto be English teachers. One of my intentions this semester i
 s to\nillustrate how they can use literature like 'The Hate U Give' to wor
 k\nagainst perpetuating linguistic racism\, anti-blackness and violence in
 \ntheir future classrooms.”\n\nBoth Baker-Bell's and Johnson’s student
 s attended a screening of\n\"The Hate U Give\,\" which was recently releas
 ed as a major motion\npicture by 20th Century Fox\, at a local Lansing mov
 ie theater on Oct.\n22 and Oct. 24.\n\nTiffany Whittington\, a junior majo
 ring in English\, found the film to\nbe realistic and emotional. However\,
  reading and discussing the book\nhas provided her with opportunities to e
 xplore language beyond what\nshe describes as a traditional study.\n\nWhit
 tington describes the book as “woke\,” and an excellent choice\nto tra
 in future teachers.\n\n“It uses black language and shows the reality of 
 being black and\nliving in America\,” she said. “These are aspects tha
 t future\nteachers should be aware of before they start teaching.”\n\nTh
 e decision to use the novel \"The Hate U Give\" and to design an\nentire e
 vent series around the study of Thomas’ book is on par with\nwhat Baker-
 Bell intends to achieve with the book she is currently\nwriting on linguis
 tic justice — a framework to implement in the\nclassroom that will best 
 reach linguistically marginalized students of\ncolor\, particularly black 
 youth.\n\nWhittington noted \"The Hate U Give\" points to what she already
  knew\nabout racial bias.\n\n“Being black in America means you must proc
 eed with caution\,\" she\nsaid. \"Society fears us as black individuals\, 
 and if you aren’t\ncareful\, you can easily lose your life.\"\n\nThe THU
 G Event Series includes a dialogue and live Twitter chat from\n5:30 to 7:3
 0 p.m. Nov. 5\, in Erickson Hall.\n\nThe next event on Dec. 5 is a collabo
 ration between MSU English\neducation students and faculty who will come t
 ogether with an English\nlanguage arts class from Detroit Denby High Schoo
 l. The final event on\nJan. 12\, THUG Teach-in\, is a professional develop
 ment event for\neducators interested in receiving support and teaching res
 ources for\nthe book \"The Hate U Give.\" This event is open to the public
