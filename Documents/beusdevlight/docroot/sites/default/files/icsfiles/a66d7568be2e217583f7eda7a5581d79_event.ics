SUMMARY:&#039\;THUG&#039\; Event
CLASS:PUBLIC
DESCRIPTION:Description: [sample image]\nBaker-Bell\, assistant professor i
 n the Department of English and\nAfrican-American and African Studies prog
 ram\, and Johnson\, assistant\nprofessor in the Department of English\, ch
 ose \"The Hate U Give\"\nbecause it fosters opportunities for language stu
 dy beyond standard\nAmerican English. Instead\, the course challenges stud
 ents to consider\nhow language\, particularly black or African-American la
 nguage\, informs\nidentity and experience.\n\n“For me\, 'The Hate U Give
 ' illustrates how black language reflects\nblack people’s ways of knowin
 g\, interpreting\, surviving and being in\nthe world\,” Baker-Bell said.
  “The book also shows how it is nearly\nimpossible to separate a person
 ’s language from their racial\npositioning in society. Most of the stude
 nts in ENG 302 are preparing\nto be English teachers. One of my intentions
  this semester is to\nillustrate how they can use literature like 'The Hat
 e U Give' to work\nagainst perpetuating linguistic racism\, anti-blackness
  and violence in\ntheir future classrooms.”\n\nBoth Baker-Bell's and Joh
 nson’s students attended a screening of\n\"The Hate U Give\,\" which was
  recently released as a major motion\npicture by 20th Century Fox\, at a l
 ocal Lansing movie theater on Oct.\n22 and Oct. 24.\n\nTiffany Whittington
 \, a junior majoring in English\, found the film to\nbe realistic and emot
 ional. However\, reading and discussing the book\nhas provided her with op
 portunities to explore language beyond what\nshe describes as a traditiona
 l study.\n\nWhittington describes the book as “woke\,” and an excellen
 t choice\nto train future teachers.\n\n“It uses black language and shows
  the reality of being black and\nliving in America\,” she said. “These
  are aspects that future\nteachers should be aware of before they start te
 aching.”\n\nThe decision to use the novel \"The Hate U Give\" and to des
 ign an\nentire event series around the study of Thomas’ book is on par w
 ith\nwhat\nBakes/2018/thug-event-series-examines-language-tackles-race-and
 -bias/r-Bell\nintends to achieve with the book she is currently writing on
 \nlinguistic justice — a framework to implement in the classroom that\nw
 ill best reach linguistically marginalized students of color\,\nparticular
 ly black youth.\n\nWhittington noted \"The Hate U Give\" points to what sh
 e already knew\nabout racial bias.\n\n“Being black in America means you 
 must proceed with caution\,\" she\nsaid. \"Society fears us as black indiv
 iduals\, and if you aren’t\ncareful\, you can easily lose your life.\"\n
 \nThe THUG Event Series includes a dialogue and live Twitter chat from\n5:
 30 to 7:30 p.m. Nov. 5\, in Erickson\nHall.s/2018/thug-event-series-examin
 es-language-tackles-race-and-bias/\n\nThe next event on Dec. 5 is a collab
 oration between MSU English\neducation students and faculty who will come 
 together with an English\nlanguage arts class from Detroit Denby High Scho
 ol. The final event on\nJan. 12\, THUG Teach-in\, is a professional develo
 pment event for\neducators interested in receiving support and teaching re
 sources for\nthe book \"The Hate U Give.\" This event is open to the publi
 c.\n Start Date: Wed\, 02/06/2019 - 10:55 End Date: [node:field_event_date
