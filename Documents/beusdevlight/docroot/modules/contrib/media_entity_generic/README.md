# Media Entity Generic

## About Media Entity Generic

This module exists as a bridge between Media Entity 8.x-1.x and Media in core
(after Drupal 8.4.x).

**You ONLY need this module if you have a site with Media Entities that are
using the "Generic" provider, and you want to upgrade to the new Media-in-core
solution.**

You can find more information about the upgrade instructions on the
[Media Entity](https://www.drupal.org/project/media_entity)
module page, and on [this issue](https://www.drupal.org/node/2880334).
